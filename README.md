# ATM-Controller

This is an ATM Controller program and its tests implemented in Java.

## Run the ATM Controller and tests 

ATM-Controller requires [Java JDK 16.0.2](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk16-archive-downloads.html) to run. Since Java is platform independent, it is supposed to run on any OS. However, only macOS Big Sur (Version 11.6) was used to test the program. So, it is recommended to use the same environment. The setup instructions below use an environment on macOS. Also, the program was tested under IntelliJ idea 2021.2.2 (community edition) and Junit 4 (4.13.1).
